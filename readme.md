Hey there!
So this is a messaging web-app I created to help the folks in my college socializing.
This is still in development stage.
One of the key feature this app will have in future is that people either connected to the same network or either in their vicinity will be able to interact with other people.
This has a major application in my university as many folks that I have encountered are somewhat shy to make the first step present the ideas and make a nice conversation.
The soul mission that I have is to give each indivisual a voice and a platform to speak what they want.
So that we enchance and embrace the freedom of speech.
